# CoAP-Covert-Channels
We present two covert channels in CoAP. One using artificial reconnections, the other using artificial resets (resulting in the proposal of a new [hiding pattern](https://patterns.omi.uni-ulm.de). The code was implemented by S. Zillien.

This repository contains the proof-of-concept code for the publication:

L. Hartmann, S. Zillien, S. Wendzel: *[Reset- and Reconnection-based Covert Channels in CoAP](https://doi.org/10.1145/3487405.3487660)*, in Proc. European Interdisciplinary Cybersecurity Conference ([EICC'21](https://www.fvv.um.si/eicc2021/)), ACM, 2021, to be held virtually in November 2021. The paper was part of the EICC's [DETONATOR'21](https://www.fvv.um.si/eicc2021/detonator.html) session.
